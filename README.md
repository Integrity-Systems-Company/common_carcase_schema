# Common Carcase Schema

Currently, MLA receives a number of carcase feedback data “feeds” from processors and other sources that are used to support industry programs and tools including but not limited to NLIS, LPA, MSA, LDL, DEXA, Disease & Defect, etc.

These data feeds are delivered to MLA via multiple delivery mechanisms (CSV etc) and much of the information included in the data feeds is duplicative. This places a costly burden on data providers (processors, software providers) to maintain and therefore has a negative effect on their ability to support change requests, as changes often have to be made in multiple places, even for small updates.

The fragmented nature of the provision of feeds also increases the risk of defects and failure across systems and creates multiple security concerns and data management overheads. MLA is developing capability to support these kinds of scenarios, providing infrastructure to among other benefits, bring duplicative data sets together. Therefore, there is an opportunity to develop functionality to create a single feed channel for processor data within MLA programs accessible by all MLA systems and with development to broader industry stakeholders.
